I am a **Senior Product Engineer** based in Dublin, Ireland. I bridge the gap between complex UI/UX design and scalable, high-performance code.
Since 2009, I’ve been crafting user-centric web solutions. My expertise lies in taking full ownership of the frontend lifecycle—from initial design systems to robust, tested production code. ✨

### Technical Focus & Architecture 

I specialize in building resilient React applications with a focus on performance and developer velocity:

*   **Core Stack**: Expert-level **React** and **Next.js 15+** (App Router & Server Components).
*   **State Management**: Architecting hybrid state solutions using **Redux Toolkit (RTK)** for complex logic and **TanStack Query** for server-state.
*   **Quality Assurance**: Committed to "zero-regression" deployments using **Cypress** for end-to-end testing (and studying Playwright).
*   **AI-Augmented Workflow**: Leveraging **GitHub Copilot** and AI-driven tools to accelerate refactoring, unit testing, and boilerplate management.
